## How do you use it?

Put the `Acxel` directory in your Sublime Text `Packages` directory (`Sublime Text` -> `Preferences` -> `Browse Packages...`). Select some text in Sublime Text (possibly text with some aesthetic qualities). Right-click and "Acxel"-ify.

This will copy some JavaScript to your clipboard. Paste the JavaScript into your browser's Console window.

You can right click on the image to save it. These images have been enlarged 4 times, so you don't have to squint. Here's what the code for the plugin looks like, in case you were wondering.
